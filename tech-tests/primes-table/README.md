Coding exercise - Prime tables

How to tackle the problem
This is intended to take you about an hour. But the aim is not to see how much you can code in a given time, itâ€™s to see how you tackle a coding problem. You may use whatever programming language you like, but you might like to know that we tend to use C# and Javascript internally.

You should put your code onto GitHub. We will review it from there. Please include a README file that says:
How to run it
How long you spent on it
What you would do with it if you had more time

The requirements
Write an application that will output a multiplication table.

The user should input a whole number N, where is N is required to be at least 1. The application should output an N x N grid of numbers. The first row and the first column should both contain the first N prime numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, etc) and every other cell should be the product of the first number in that row and that column.

For example, the 3rd prime number is 3 and the 5th prime number is 7. So the number in the 3rd row and 5th column should be 21 (which is 3 x 7).
